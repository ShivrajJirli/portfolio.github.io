            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>Introduction to Water Supply Pipeline Network Design in a City</h3>
            <p>The efficient distribution of water is a critical infrastructure requirement in urban environments. This project focuses on designing an optimized water supply pipeline network for a city, leveraging principles and techniques from the domain of Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA). Water pipeline networks form the backbone of urban water supply systems, ensuring that households, industries, and public facilities have access to clean water.</p>
            <p>The domain involves computational problem-solving in graph theory, optimization, and data structures to address challenges such as minimizing pipeline costs, ensuring consistent water pressure, and adapting to dynamic demand. Algorithms like Dijkstra's and Kruskal's are employed to find shortest paths and construct minimum spanning trees, respectively, for cost-efficient network layouts. Additionally, advanced data structures such as segment trees and union-find are utilized to manage and analyze network configurations effectively.</p>
            <p>This project integrates these techniques to develop a reliable, efficient, and adaptable water distribution system. It addresses real-world issues like low-pressure zones, leakage detection, and maintenance planning. By applying theoretical concepts to practical scenarios, the project demonstrates the intersection of algorithmic design and urban planning, offering a model that can be scaled or adapted for various city layouts and requirements.</p>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <h3> Domain</h3>
            <p>Managing urban water distribution networks is challenging due to rising demand, uneven pressure, leakage, and high operational costs. Manual monitoring is inefficient, making it essential to automate the design and optimization of pipeline networks. This project focuses on ensuring cost-effective, consistent, and sustainable water distribution across a city.</p>
            <h3> Module Description</h3>
            <p>For the "Water Supply Pipeline Network Design in a City" project, my focus has been on the algorithmic backbone and optimization modules of the system. I have worked specifically on the following components:</p>
            <h3> Shortest Path For Maintenance using Dijkstra’s Algorithm</h3>
            <p>I designed a module to compute the shortest path between any two houses, aiding in quick maintenance responses. This feature ensures minimal disruption during repairs or inspections.</p>
            <h3> Complaint Registration System using queue And KMP</h3>
            <p>I designed a complaint-handling system using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) string-matching algorithm to efficiently locate house IDs and categorize complaints based on keywords. Additionally, I utilized a queue data structure to manage complaints in the order they were received. This ensures fair and sequential processing of complaints, making the system more user-friendly and organized.</p><br><br>
